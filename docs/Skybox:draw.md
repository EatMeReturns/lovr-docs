Skybox:draw
===

Draws a skybox at a specified angle.

    skybox:draw(angle, ax, ay, az)

### Arguments

- `number angle` The number of radians to rotate the skybox around its axis of rotation.
- `number ax` The x component of the vector representing the axis of rotation.
- `number ay` The y component of the vector representing the axis of rotation.
- `number az` The z component of the vector representing the axis of rotation.

### Returns

Nothing

Notes
---

Skyboxes are drawn without depth, meaning anything drawn before the skybox will be covered by the
skybox and the skybox will be behind anything drawn after it.

Because of this, it's usually a good idea to draw a skybox before drawing other geometry.
Additionally, a specialized shader is used to render the skybox.  This means it is not currently
possible to use a custom shader to render skyboxes.

Also note that cubemap Skyboxes require a special Shader to be drawn correctly.  If the default
Shader is set when drawing the Skybox (by calling `lovr.graphics.setShader()`), LÃ–VR will
automatically use a default skybox shader:

```
// Vertex
out vec3 texturePosition;
vec4 position(mat4 projection, mat4 transform, vec4 vertex) {
  texturePosition = vertex.xyz;
  return projection * transform * vertex;
}

// Fragment
in vec3 texturePosition;
uniform samplerCube cube;
vec4 color(vec4 graphicsColor, sampler2D image, vec2 uv) {
  return graphicsColor * texture(cube, texturePosition);
}
```

Drawing a Skybox in VR

    function lovr.load()
      skybox = lovr.graphics.newSkybox({
        '1.png',
        '2.png',
        '3.png',
        '4.png',
        '5.png',
        '6.png'
      })
    end

    function lovr.draw()
      lovr.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
      skybox:draw(lovr.headset.getOrientation())

      -- Draw everything else
    end
