BallJoint
===

A BallJoint creates a ball and socket between two colliders.  It anchors them at a single point but
allows free rotation around the point.  It extends `Joint` with the following functions:

<table>
<tr>
  <td class="pre">BallJoint:getAnchors</td>
  <td>Get the anchors of the joint.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="pre">BallJoint:setAnchor</td>
  <td>Set the anchor point.</td>
</tr>
</table>
