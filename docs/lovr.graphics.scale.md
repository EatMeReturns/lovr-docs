lovr.graphics.scale
---

Scales the coordinate system in 3 dimensions.  This will cause objects to appear bigger or smaller.

The scaling will last until `lovr.draw` exits or the transformation is popped off the transformation
stack.

Note that order matters when scaling, translating, and rotating the coordinate system.

#### Arguments
