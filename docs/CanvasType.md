CanvasType
===

When creating Canvases, they can be created in either "2d" or "3d" mode.  2D mode is good for 2D
user interfaces or postprocessing, whereas 3d is useful for portals, weapon scopes, mirrors, and
other situations where 3D content needs to be rendered.

Values
---

- `2d` Optimize the canvas for rendering 2d content using an orthographic projection.
- `3d` Optimize the canvas for rendering 3d content using a perspective projection.
