lovr.graphics
---

The `lovr.graphics` API handles rendering graphics to the window.  Although LÖVR is focused on VR,
you can use it to render 3D graphics with or without a VR headset.  If the `lovr.headset` module is
enabled, LÖVR will render to each eye of the headset, otherwise everything will be rendered to a
window on the desktop.
