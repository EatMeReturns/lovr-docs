Cube
===

<!-- code -->

LÃ–VR provides a graphics primitive for drawing a cube, `lovr.graphics.cube`.  Here, we use it
to draw a cube at (0, 0, -1) which is in front of the camera.  We use .5 meters for the size and use
`lovr.timer.getTime` for the angle of rotation so the cube appears to animate its rotation over time.
